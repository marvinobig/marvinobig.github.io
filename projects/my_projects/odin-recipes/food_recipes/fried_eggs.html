                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Over medium eggs are just like over easy eggs, except the yolk cooks longer until it is partially set, but still creamy. 
                    A great over medium egg will have a jammy yolk that is neither runny nor completely set.</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat a non-stick or a cast iron skillet over medium heat with 1 tablespoon cooking oil until the oil starts to shimmer.
                            If using butter, wait until it stops sizzling, but before it starts to turn brown.</li>
                           
                            <br>

                        <li>Add the egg to the skillet.</li> 

                            <br>

                        <li>When the whites are firm and the bottom of the yolk is set, after 2 to 3 minutes,
                            use a large spatula to flip it, turning the egg gently, so the yolk doesn't break.</li>
                           
                            <br>

                        <li>Cook for 60 to 90 seconds more and serve with the flipped side up, then season to taste.</li>
                    </ol>
