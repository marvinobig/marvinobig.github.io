            <i>Classroom Conversation</i><br><br>
            Howard sitting in class doing his work,<br> 
            door opens slowly and here comes Salem walking towards Howard with a smile on his face.<br> 
            When Howard realised it was Salem,<br> 
            he then changes his seating position towards bf wondering what bf is doing in the class.<br><br>
            
            <b>Salem:</b><br>
            Hey Howard, how are you? 
            What are you up to?,<br> 
            I’ve been searching for you.<br><br>

            <b>Howard:</b><br>
            Nothing much, you know just doing my interface design which is due next week.<br><br>

            <b>Salem:</b><br>
            (Looks around)<br>
            Oh right, okay.<br>
            Listen I’ve got something for you that you would like.<br>
            (with a smile on his face)<br><br>

            <b>Howard:</b><br>
            (shakes his head)<br>
            You’re always full of surprises.<br>
            What kind of surprise is it again?<br><br>

            <b>Salem:</b><br>
            (smiles)<br>
            Remember the product you saw me using last time?<br><br>

            <b>Howard:</b><br>
            Yes, why?<br><br>

            <b>Salem:</b><br>
            Well, I have the dealer’s number.<br> 
            (takes a card out)<br>
            Give him a call and he will meet up with you.<br> 
            (tap Howards back)<br>
            I’ll see you later.<br><br>

            <b>Howard:</b><br>
            (sadly looks away)<br>
            Why is it that you can’t get away from distractions in this university,<br>
            I can’t even work in peace.<br>
            (Looks at the card)<br><br>

            <i>Decision scene</i><br><br>
            Howard stares at table with drug dealer number in his hand.<br> 
            Focuses on right hand (with the number)<br>
            Focuses on left side of table (With university work and mom calling him)<br>
            Stressors (university work, homesickness)<br>
            Decides to take it because he thinks it would be better than having all this stress and loneliness to worry about.<br> 
            He wants to feel relaxed again.<br>
            Heads back home to call the drug dealer privately.</p><br><br>
