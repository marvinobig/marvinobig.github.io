# Rich-Media-Final

## Installation Guide


## Objectives
Create an animated storyboard of groups final version of the movie script which will include sound (i.e. music, sound effects, dialogue etc.).

Then as a group you will use your storyboard to produce a short film. This video will be either at 1080p or 720p resolution and will be compressed with the h.264 algorithm (to limit its file size).

I will create a website to promote the film with information about the project and a web-based video player.

## Initial Ideas
The initial idea was to have one character as a teenager who was getting abused by his dad and decides to do whatever it takes for him get away from him and do what he wants to do even if it means for him to sell drugs. 

The rising action was meant to be him trying to prove himself to a his new gang as we know you have to gain their trust. After he would gain their trust but he would be stealing some drugs as he would deliver them, he wouldv'e done this for a while but he would eventually get caught and he would be asked by the dealer to pay 10 thousand pounds for what he has done. 

He couldn't afford to pay therefore he tries to steal from his dad and got beaten up badly then the dealers found him and tortured him to death. 
    
This was the intial idea for the film but our group decided that it would require too many characters to represent all the dealers and gang members and the dad. It would've been one character oriented and the film would not be dramatic enough and well rounded.In the first scene, the conversation between the salem and the drug dealer. We've decided that he speaks the street vocabulary because it potrays his character.
   
In the second scene salem meets howard in the library to give him the dealer's number, before handing it out salem asks howard if he remember seeing him use a product; this is to let the audience to that these two know each other.

Third scene; when howards calls the dealer, he's tone was low and seems to be a bit scared, this shows the audience that the dealer is dominant. The asked him to meets him at an alleyway; this shows that they are trying to hide from the public as they are doing illegal.

In howards meeting with the dealer shows how dominant and aggressive these people can be like when howard askes him about the price of the product he freaks out "dont you know what the price is, don't come here wasting my time"

Our group decided to use this final version because the dialogue was able to move the story forward every. We felt like the audience will be one step closer to the climax after each conversation in this story. 

Also this dialogue reveals relevant information about every character because each conversation shows how theyâ€™re feeling at that time and what they are about to do and lastly it helps the audience understand the relationships between each character.

Our group came to conclusion on this particular one cause it fits exactly what a dialogue in a shot film should be, short and simple and at the same time.
