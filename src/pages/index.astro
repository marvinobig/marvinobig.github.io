					<h1>HI, I'M MARVIN</h1>
					<p>
						I'm a Fullstack Developer. After my first experience with
						coding, I realized that this is something I enjoyed a lot,
						being able to have a mixture of creativity and logic and
						turning an idea into a product/service. In my spare time, I
						try to expand and develop my skills as much as I can by
						completing online courses and carrying out my own projects.
