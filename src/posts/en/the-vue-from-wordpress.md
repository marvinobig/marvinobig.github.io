As a developer looking to expand my skills, I set out to learn Vue, WordPress, and Docker. I want to  simulate a real-world setup while deepening my understanding of web development tools frequently used for websites and web apps.

## Project Rational

The best way to learn is by building real, hands-on projects. I'm using Vue, WordPress, and Docker to create a custom blog frontend from scratch. This project helps me understand how modern tools work together in a practical setup. It's a unique, portfolio-worthy build that reflects real-world development workflows.

## Project Aim

With the rational set out above, the projects main aim is to build a site using a dockerized headless WordPress site that uses Vue as a frontend to display content from this headless backend, in order to gain practical experience with Vue, WordPress, and Docker in a project that reflects real-world development workflows.

## Functional Requirements

The only functional requirements for this simple project is that it will allow its users to view all available, non-draft post and also view a single post on a separate page.

#### Simple UI Low Fidelity Wireframe

The above image perfectly encapsulates these requirements and will serve as a guide during both UI and backend development.
