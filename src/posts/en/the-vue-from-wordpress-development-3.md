So as I mentioned in my previous [post](https://marvinobig.online/posts/en/the-vue-from-wordpress-development-2/), I started on the development of the wordpress backend. Before I could actually get my hands on some code, I had to get acquainted with wordpress itself. I planned to do this via the [wordpress developer course](https://learn.wordpress.org/course/beginner-wordpress-developer/) offered by wordpress themselves. As I used this course, I started to wonder how I go about setting wordpress up locally and couldn't find any straightforward guide on this. As luck would have it though, the course I was using did have a unit covering this.

#### Local Installation Guide Placement

As the picture above shows, this unit was placed towards the end of the course. Why not at the start or after the first unit explaining what wordpress is? I mean the course goes over the REST API plugin before covering local installation. I feel this is a bit of a misplacement but other than this, the course dos do a good job of introducing wordpress to developers. I haven't completed the course due to reasons mentioned below.

Despite my wanting to learn WordPress, I've never really liked CMSs. I've always thought they were for people who want to quickly build a website without really knowing how, which I feel has lead to the somewhat bad reputation PHP has within the development community. This lack of knowledge has lead to people installing external plugins to fix all their problems, introducing security risks due to lack of updates or bad code in said plugins. However, I do think wordpress is a very good option for freelance work or developing quick solutions to business problems.

I have decided though, to not continue with learning WordPress right now. I want to go deeper with Laravel and develop that skill and I also want to get better with Vue js.
I think this is the better way to go as I already have pretty good academic experience with Laravel. I do want to eventually get back to WordPress in the future but right now I would rather work with Laravel.

#### Computing Hardware Through Time

I still want to develop "Vue From WordPress" so I'll be doing that with a laravel backend instead so the project is now titled "Vue From Laravel". I'll also be revisiting old projects and improving them slightly to make them more presentable. I've already done this with a university project from last year in which I built a website using PHP, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I revisited this project to containerize it and update the README with relevant project details and setup instructions. The site isn't hosted just yet. Maybe I'll do that later or maybe I wont (free hosting isn't so common anymore). 

The code to the site can be found [here](https://github.com/marvinobig/computing-hardware-through-time-hd.git).
