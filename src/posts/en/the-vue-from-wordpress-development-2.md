I want to keep this post short as I haven't done much.

## Where I Started

#### Individual Post View

![Individual Post View](/assets/images/blog-imgs/posts-view.webp)

I have developed all required views for the project and now Im completely moving on to wordpress development. I've really only developed the way the UI looks, most of the logic for calling and handling APIs is missing currently so I've had to fill in the UI with dummy data. 

#### Homepage View

![Homepage View](/assets/images/blog-imgs/home-view.webp)

I've tried to keep the UI simple and not too flashy as I'm not a designer (at least not yet) and I'm really only trying to demonstrate the acquisition of a new skill. This is why the homepage view is just displaying info on the project. 

#### What Next?

![Wordpress Course](/assets/images/blog-imgs/wordpress-course.webp)

I'll be moving onto the [wordpress developer course](https://learn.wordpress.org/course/beginner-wordpress-developer/) above to learn the basics of wordpress and its internal APIs. It seems comprehensive enough but I've only done three units so can't really judge its contents just yet.

The next posts will be covering what I've learned from this course.
