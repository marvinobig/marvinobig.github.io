                <p>
                    I'm a fullstack developer.
                    <br />
                    After my first experience with coding, I realized that this is
                    something I enjoyed a lot, being able to have a mixture of creativity
                    and logic and turning an idea into a product/service. In my spare
                    time, I try to expand and develop my skills as much as I can
                    by completing online courses and carrying out my own projects.
                </p>

                <h2>My Skills</h2>
                <ul>
                    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
