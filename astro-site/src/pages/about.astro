              <p>
                I'm a fullstack developer.
                <br />
                After my first experience with coding, I realized that this is
                something I enjoyed a lot, being able to have a mixture of creativity
                and logic and turning an idea into a product/service. In my spare
                time, I try to expand and develop my skills as much as I can by
                completing online courses and carrying out my own projects.
